We even hit the <strong>500.000</strong> user mark, can you imagine? <strong>A HALF MILLION USERS!</strong></p><p>There are some exciting stories I could tell you. For example how we managed to generate <strong>120TB of traffic</strong> in 1 month! That made our hosters pretty angry, I can tell you!</p><hr class="show-for-small-only"></div><div class="small-12 medium-6 columns"><h3>Technology</h3><p>ProxMate is put together by a wide range of different technologies.
